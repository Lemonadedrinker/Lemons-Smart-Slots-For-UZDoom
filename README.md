# Lemons-Smart-Slots-For-GZDoom
My implementation for customizable slots for weapons in GZDoom.
It is designed for singleplayer and multiplayer.

To use, press the "Edit Slots" key (default ') to open the user interface.
You can then click each weapon to insert into a different slot.
You can also click and drag weapons to swap the two!

## Various customization settings!

## Known issues:
- On Mac, there may be lag with the Vulkan renderer, which can be fixed by switching to OpenGL.
